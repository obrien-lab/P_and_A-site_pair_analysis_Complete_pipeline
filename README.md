# P_and_A-site_pair_analysis_Complete_pipeline
This is a complete pipeline for analysis of P and A pair analysis. 
This pipeline dividend into following steps:
1. Download Ribo-Seq data from SRA
2. Preprocessing of Ribo-Seq data. 
3. Alignment of reads file with reference sequence
4. A-site profile generate to identify read density at A-site
5. Robustness analysis of multiple dataset and create matrix for â€“ Amino acid and tRNA
